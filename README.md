## Helper tools

### SysML Syntax Explorer

The SysML Syntax Explorer is a browser-based tool to visualize how Syside parses SysML v2 code. It displays code as an interactive concrete syntax tree (CST) structure, revealing the underlying hierarchy of declarations, expressions, and other language constructs. Use this tool to accelerate Syside Automator script development to quickly identify any elements of interest and how to parse them.
